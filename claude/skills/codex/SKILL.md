# Codex Skill Guide

## When to Use Codex

Use Codex proactively for:
- Complex architectural decisions
- Deep code analysis or refactoring
- When stuck after 2+ failed attempts
- Security or performance audits
- Code reviews before commits/PRs
- When user explicitly requests GPT/Codex assistance

## Two Modes of Operation

### 1. `codex exec` - Interactive Tasks
For analysis, refactoring, debugging, or any task requiring file access and reasoning.

### 2. `codex review` - Code Reviews
For reviewing diffs, uncommitted changes, or comparing against branches.

---

## Running `codex exec`

1. Ask the user (via `AskUserQuestion`) which model to run (`gpt-5.2-codex` or `gpt-5.2`) AND which reasoning effort to use (`xhigh`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`) in a **single prompt with two questions**.

2. Select the sandbox mode required for the task; default to `--sandbox read-only` unless edits or network access are necessary.

3. Assemble the command with the appropriate options:
   - `-m, --model <MODEL>`
   - `--config model_reasoning_effort="<xhigh|high|medium|low>"`
   - `--sandbox <read-only|workspace-write|danger-full-access>`
   - `--full-auto`
   - `-C, --cd <DIR>`
   - `--skip-git-repo-check`

4. Always use `--skip-git-repo-check`.

5. **IMPORTANT**: Append `2>/dev/null` to suppress thinking tokens (stderr). Only show stderr if debugging is needed.

6. Run the command, capture output, and summarize the outcome for the user.

7. After completion, inform the user: "You can resume this Codex session at any time by saying 'codex resume'."

### Quick Reference - exec

| Use case | Sandbox mode | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only analysis | `read-only` | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -m MODEL --sandbox read-only "prompt" 2>/dev/null` |
| Apply local edits | `workspace-write` | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -m MODEL --sandbox workspace-write --full-auto "prompt" 2>/dev/null` |
| Network/broad access | `danger-full-access` | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -m MODEL --sandbox danger-full-access --full-auto "prompt" 2>/dev/null` |
| Resume session | Inherited | `echo "prompt" \| codex exec --skip-git-repo-check resume --last 2>/dev/null` |
| Different directory | Match task | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -C <DIR> -m MODEL --sandbox read-only "prompt" 2>/dev/null` |

### Resuming Sessions

When continuing a previous session:
```bash
echo "your prompt here" | codex exec --skip-git-repo-check resume --last 2>/dev/null
```
- Don't use configuration flags unless explicitly requested
- All flags go between `exec` and `resume`

## Running `codex review`

Use for code review tasks. No need to ask for model/reasoning - review uses sensible defaults.

1. Ask the user (via `AskUserQuestion`) what to review:
   - **Uncommitted changes** - all local modifications
   - **Against a branch** - compare to base branch (e.g., `main`)
   - **Specific commit** - review a commit SHA

2. Optionally ask for custom review focus (security, performance, conventions, etc.)

3. Run the appropriate command and summarize findings.

### Quick Reference - review

| Use case | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Uncommitted changes | `codex review --uncommitted` |
| Against main branch | `codex review --base main` |
| Against specific branch | `codex review --base feature/xyz` |
| Specific commit | `codex review --commit abc123` |
| With custom focus | `codex review --uncommitted "Focus on security"` |
| With title context | `codex review --base main --title "Add user auth"` |

### Configuration Overrides

```bash
# Use specific model
codex review --uncommitted -c model="o3"
```

---

## Decision Guide: exec vs review

| Situation | Use |
| --- | --- |
| "Review my changes" | `codex review --uncommitted` |
| "Review this PR" | `codex review --base main` |
| "Analyze this architecture" | `codex exec` |
| "Help me debug this" | `codex exec` |
| "Refactor this code" | `codex exec` with workspace-write |
| "Is this secure?" | `codex review` for diffs, `codex exec` for deep analysis |

---

## Following Up

- After every command, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm next steps or collect clarifications
- For `exec`: offer to resume with `codex exec resume --last`
- For `review`: offer to help address specific findings
- Restate the chosen configuration when proposing follow-up actions

## Error Handling

- Stop and report failures on non-zero exit; request direction before retrying
- Before using high-impact flags (`--full-auto`, `--sandbox danger-full-access`), ask user permission via `AskUserQuestion` unless already given
- Summarize warnings or partial results and ask how to adjust
